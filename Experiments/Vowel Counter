% is_vowel(Char) - checks if a character is a vowel
is_vowel(a).
is_vowel(e).
is_vowel(i).
is_vowel(o).
is_vowel(u).

% count_vowels(+List, -Count)
% Base case: an empty list has 0 vowels.
count_vowels([], 0).

% Recursive case 1: The head is a vowel. Increment the count and recurse.
count_vowels([H|T], Count) :-
    is_vowel(H),
    count_vowels(T, RestCount),
    Count is RestCount + 1.

% Recursive case 2: The head is not a vowel. The count does not change.
count_vowels([H|T], Count) :-
    \+ is_vowel(H),
    count_vowels(T, Count).

% Example queries:
% ?- count_vowels([h, e, l, l, o], Count). % Count will be 2
% ?- count_vowels(hello, Count).           % Prolog treats "hello" as a list of characters, so this also works
